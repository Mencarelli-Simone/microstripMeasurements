    This report contains the results for the microstrip line test produced using vector measurements of the reflection
    and transmission frequency response of three test fixtures of different lengths.
    The shorter fixture is shown in \fig{fig:photo}.
    The three fixtures feature a microstrip line built using an adhesive copper strip 5~mm wide on a piece of dielectric
    composite (Material Under Test) glued on a supporting aluminium slab.
    Two thru-hole connectors are bolted to the structure with the central pin trimmed to length and soldered to the copper line.
    From here on, the fixtures are referred to by their line length; respectively: long~=~219~mm (L), medimum~=~146~mm (M), and
    short~=~40mm (S).\\
    The complex propagation coefficient $\gamma$ extraction procedure is defined in \ref{doc:microstrip-characterization} and
    applied here with minor modifications.
    An overview of the methodology and the results of this de-embedding procedure are reported in~\sref{sec:de-embedding}.\\
    The error sensitivity to small differences in the average permittivity of the fixtures is derived in~\sref{sec:error}
    in an effort to explain the discrepancies found in the results of~\sref{sec:de-embedding}.\\
    The procedure for fitting the measured datum to a CST microstrip model is reported in~\sref{sec:numerical-model-matching}
    along with the resulting permittivity and loss tangent of the \emph{Material Under Test} (MUT).\\
    The conclusions are drawn in~\sref{sec:conclusion}.

    \section{De-embedding results}
    \label{sec:de-embedding}

    %% De embedding procedure modification

    %% results outline

    The de-embedding results (virtual transmission line properties) are here presented in terms of:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Transmissivity, i.e., the S21 of the de embedded length of transmission line, denoted with \emph{t}.
        \item Reflectivity, i.e., the S21 of the de embedded length of transmission line, denoted with \emph{s}.
        \item Effective permittivity $\varepsilon_{eff}$.
        \item Effective loss tangent $\tan\delta_{eff}$.
    \end{itemize}
    The effective permittivity and loss tangent are for visualization purposes only and are formulated from the low-loss
    approximation~\cite{Pozar} for transmission lines (assuming all loss lumped into the dielectric material and
    the phase velocity independent of loss).\\
    The effective permittivity is given by
    \begin{equation}
        \varepsilon_{eff} = \left(\dfrac{ c [\text{unwrap}(\angle{t}) + n2\pi]} {2\pi f L}\right)^2,
        \label{eq:epsilon}
    \end{equation}
    where $c$ is the speed of light, $L$ is the line length, $f$ is the frequency and $n$ an integer to correctly reconstruct
    the true--time phase delay (usually n=0 if the first sample of $f$ is small enough).\\
    The loss tangent is defined as
    \begin{equation}
        \tan \delta_{eff} = -\dfrac{\ln(|t|) c}{L \pi f \sqrt{\varepsilon_{eff}}}.
        \label{eq:tand}
    \end{equation}
    A better figure that can be used to make the measurement results independent from the physical length $L$, is the
    complex propagation constant
    \begin{equation}
        \gamma = \alpha + j \beta = \ln(t) / L,
        \label{eq:gamma}
    \end{equation}
    used in \sref{sec:numerical-model-matching} to match the CST model to the measured data.\\

    Note how all the above depend (measurand) exclusively on the transmissivity $t$.
    While, the reflectivity $s$, using the de-embedding procedure of~\ref{doc:microstrip-characterization}, can be
    considered as a function of the de-embedding error, as it should be 0 in the ideal case. \\
    For the measured data, it was noted that the response $s$ varies changing the gate width from the, originally considered, distance between
    two reflections to a smaller value.
    Since this changes improves or degrades the value of $s$ in different parts of the spectrum, it was chosen to modify
    the de-embedding algorithm of~\ref{doc:microstrip-characterization}, to sweep over several values for the gate width
    and then perform a weighted average of the different resulting $t$--curves using the $s$--curves as a logarithmic
    weighting factors for every frequency bin .\\
    This sensibility to changes in the gates widths is probably due to some irregularities in the measured transmission lines,
    far from being perfectly homogeneous due to the manufacturing process.
    This change in gate length, in theory, should not impact negatively on the overall result as it is equivalent to
    performing a low-pass filtering of the time impulse response of the transitions to be removed.
    In fact, the average $s$ value over frequency reduces when this weighted average technique is introduced. \\
    Moreover, instead of always using the longer transmission line to generate the transition scattering matrices to de--embedd the
    shorter transmission line, all combinations of measurement/simulation pairs are computed.
    Although using the longer line as reference provides the best theoretical frequency resolution, is interesting to see
    what happens in the reversed case where the transition scattering parameters have a naturally shorter (low--pass)
    time response, and hence a smoother shape in frequency.\\
    The resulting de-embedded virtual lines can therefore either have a causal or an anti--causal response.
    For ease of comparison all the signs in the data plots are normalized to always represent the equivalent anti--causal
    transmission lines, e.g., \laser{LS} is the \emph{anti-causal} (negative length) line obtained de--embedding the line S from the transitions
    T-matrices obtained from the response of L, and vice versa \laser{SL} is the \emph{causal} line of identical positive length.

        Solid lines: transmissivity (s), dotted lines: reflectivity (t); for all the combinations plus LS deembedding
        without gate width variation. The transmissivity sign is chosen to always correspond to a negative-length section
        of lossy transmission line (for ease of comparison).}

    \begin{figure}[!tb]
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{epsisim}
        \caption{Simulated data retrieved effective permittivity compared with $\varepsilon_{eff}$ calculated from
        the $S_{21}$ of a full--wave simulation of a microstrip section (terminated on adaptive waveguide ports),
            and effective dielectric constant computed by the port mode solver of CST.}
        \label{fig:epsilonsim}
    \end{figure}
    \begin{figure}[!tb]
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{tandsim}
        \caption{Simulated data retrieved effective loss tangent compared with $\tan\delta_{eff}$ calculated from
        the $S_{21}$ of a full--wave simulation of a microstrip section (terminated on adaptive waveguide ports),
            and effective loss tangent computed by the port mode solver of CST.}
        \label{fig:tandsim}
    \end{figure}
    In order to validate the modified de-embedding algorithm, a run wit simulated data, from the same CST models
    of~\ref{doc:microstrip-characterization} was performed.
    To observe the effect of the weighted average step, one run for the de-embedding algorithm is set to use the widest
    possible gate (as in~\ref{doc:microstrip-characterization}).
    The S-parameter results in~\fig{fig:sparasim} show that the averaging slightly improves on the ripple and the $s$
    response (especially at the edges) wile not changing substantially the response.
    The permittivity,~\fig{fig:epsilonsim}, and loss tangent~\fig{fig:tandsim}, results are compared with the
    equivalent values computed form the complex propagation constant of the waveguide port mode solver of CST, and
    from a full-wave simulation of a section of microstrip line terminated on to two adaptive waveguide ports.\\
    The reason behind the large difference between the port mode solver result and and the full wave solution in~\fig{fig:epsilonsim}
    is unclear.
    The slight difference between the de-embedding results and the full wave result (in~\fig{fig:epsilonsim}), instead,
    might be caused by a phase error due to finite meshing of the model or other numerical inaccuracies.
    The full-wave reference should be in any case the most accurate representation of the de-embedded virtual line and the
    total error appears reasonably small.\\
    The results in~\fig{fig:tandsim} seem all to be in good agreement (at least in the central portion of the spectrum),
    with ripple and \emph{edge diffraction} effects that seem to be most severe in the \laser{SL} case.

    \section{Conclusions}
    \label{sec:conclusion}
    The manufacturing process needs to be improved for repeatability.
    The material is lossy, might still be usable for a reflectarray, definitely not a good choice for traveling--wave antennas.
